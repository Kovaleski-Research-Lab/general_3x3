## This folder contains supplementary items that contributed to some of the choices made for building this dataset.

1. `sim_states` : Just some convenience code showing how to save and load a meep simulation state.

2. `gaussian_width` : Shows the relationship between meep frequency and wavelength

3. `resolution_study` : Determines the best resolution to run the 3x3 simulations - The study suggests 60 is good, but we ran them at 80.

4. `core_study` : Determines the optimal number of cores at which to run the simulation

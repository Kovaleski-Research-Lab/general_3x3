# general_3x3

A wrapper for [meep code](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) that generates a dataset of 3x3 meta-atom pillars. The radii of the pillars are generated randomly from the 75 nm to 150 nm range (See [single pillar sim](https://github.com/Kovaleski-Research-Lab/single_pillar_sim) for reference).
